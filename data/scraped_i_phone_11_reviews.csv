0,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Do not buy iphone or expensive product from Amazom,1,"Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible."
1,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Don‚Äôt buy it from this seller,1,"Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren‚Äôt working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren‚Äôt working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don‚Äôt regret after."
2,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Solid premium phone from Apple,5,Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.
3,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,GOT CHEATED . ITS A SCAM. AMAZON FIX THIS,1,This is a big scam. I received the iphone 11 yesterday and it turned out to be a defective piece . The audio doesn‚Äôt record when you are recording a video. Multiple other issues like phone not turning on even after being on full charge . So it says 10 days replacement on this. So I clicked on it and Amazon says we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact Apple . Apple says our service Centers are not having any slots so we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact amazon . What is this ? You torture a customer as soon as you make money . And that too for such en expensive phone . I demand a replacement for my phone right now Amazon ! Don‚Äôt play with people‚Äôs hard earned money . Guys stay away from this Apple days sale .
4,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Worst Experience Ever.!,1,"My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn‚Äôt Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It‚Äôs producing too much heat..

No one would like to repair new phone üò¢ Better Go for shop To buy apple products ."
5,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,First Time iPhone User Review :-),5,"The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it."

10,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,not a good product,1,"helloPlease dont take any apple products online , especially if the seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd.I bought iphone 11 last month and suudenly today (17/08/2020) the phone got switched off and not getting switched on again.It was neither damaged nor it got wet in rains . I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller."
11,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Dont rush to buy and waste your money,1,"If its just looks what you want then go ahead and buy...but its performance..then suggest you guys to back off.I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up. Show some sense of urgency towards customer issues.Ok...folks its upto you to buy or not, just sharing my own experience so it will help who are thinking to buy this."

16,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Defective model,1,"hiI had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon.But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to serversFinding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work finebut it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to worktoday while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not workingI have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain"
17,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals,5,"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need."

27,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,IT‚ÄôS A TRAP,1,"Worst ever! Battery health starts to drop within 3 months of usage. Camera for pictures suck when compared to OnePlus or other android phones.

28,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB,5,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging."

Had to travel  to hp so put it into use 4 days back There is a problem with sound very low sound have to put it on speaker to hear the conversation .

31,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,With a new design and good features,5,"This phone is bit big to hold but good for Android users.As per the design review, the phone is excellent with great camera both normal and wide angle, a good sound quality and the replicate feature was awesome to to copy data from old iPhone to your new iPhone."
32,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Absolutely LOVE it !!!,5,"I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).So don‚Äôt worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren‚Äôt functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people‚Äôs complaints."
33,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Lack of customer loyalty and too many faulty devices,1,Freaking pathetic when the phone was a defective piece and wanted to replace/refund.. they say contact the apple brand and when I go to them they say they don't have any connection since it was bought from Amazon and when I contacted the Amazon someone names ( TANMAYA) was in touch as customer service agent was trying to toss me around here and there ...and when I ask for a denial letter that Amazon and they claim they aren't responsible for this..
34,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Awesome product...great price,1,the product is good and working up to expectations....sorry for miss understanding the issue and I was under the impression that the product was defective...as I wasn‚Äôt hearing the voice of other person speaking....this happened because of thin flap of covering on screen
35,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,I phone 11,5,Awesome phone great camera quality .
36,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Good product but do not buy it from this retailer appario retail pvt ltd,1,"Do not ,I repeat do not buy iPhone from this retailer. My phone stopped turning on after 2 weeks of purchase . After giving it to the service center it had to be sent to Bangalore where it was replaced and sent back to me again. But I was without my phone for almost a month. My phone is working fine now but all in all it was such a hassle. Never buy an apple product from this  retailer called appario retail pvt ltd.Best to buy it from the store."
37,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Received faulty phone,1,"Received faulty phone.Don't buy here, buy from store. I am suffering from a problem with this phone but Amazon is directing me to the iPhone store now rather than return or replacement, so what's the point in purchasing from amazon."
38,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,"Read it, it is helpful!!!!",3,"The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it. The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone . Even from a small distance you can get small visual small cracks"
39,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Great smartphone! Value for money!! & Premium feel!!!,5,"If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future."
40,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,"Received Defective, Screen Bleeding Issue",1,"Received Defective, Screen Bleeding Issue"
41,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Damaged Phone Supplied by Amazon,1,"Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen.After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.Horrible experience with #Amazon. üò≠Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone. Further I don't have idea for battery, face recognition and camera as I was not able to use iphone 11 and till now I have only bitter experience."
42,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Best thing that money can buy,5,"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!"
43,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Average,3,"Display is not at par. even after adjusting the colour settings. More of Yellow tint.Screen width is not suitable for e- reading in phone.Top notch is disturbance for watching videos in full screen.Keyboard is occupying half of the phone space.Camera, I think my expectations are on higher side.Side button disconnects the call and doesn‚Äôt lock the screen during the calls.However phone performance and sound are good.In my opinion I should have waited for iPhone 12."
44,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Overall a great phone just not a perfect one.,4,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV."
45,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,"Trust In Amazon, INTACT !",5,"First i would like to write about the Online Shopping Platform : AMAZON.Amazon is and i believe will be the best and the most trusted e-commerce brands in the country.Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there.But my answer would be, GO FOR IT.I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC.No doubts remain anymore.Well that being said, nothing is permanent.I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone.Keep it up.Good delivery, on time.Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight.I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints.Delivery: Good.Product Packaging: Very Good.Notifications: Good.Shopping Experience: Good.About the product, well you guys, know about it very well already.One stop shop for all my shopping needs.AMAZON is the way to go !"
46,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Beast with a limp,4,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware."
47,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Phone Awesome. Amazon Service Bad.,2,MRP on product is 69k for 128gb variant but Amazon is selling for 73.6k saying revised price after April‚Äô2020. Is this justified?Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment.

54,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Received a defective product and not able to return Or replace. Please do not buy online.,1,I have received this product with defective speakers. Amazon is saying to visit Apple website. I have no clue what to do in this regard? At first place you send us a defective product and instead of initiating a replacement you ask us to visit Apply store. Is this even fair?

58,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,The best decision of my life,5,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not."
59,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Great battery+camera+Apple Quality!,5,"After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that it‚Äôs totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, it‚Äôs been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only!If you‚Äôre looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it!There are a few bugs however, but they‚Äôre iOS bugs which‚Äôll be sorted soon I‚Äôm sure with upcoming updates!"
60,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Honest review. Must read.,4,"Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating.."
61,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,New iPhone received today with dead battery!,1,"Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details."
62,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Best Buy iphone!,5,"Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!"
63,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,defective  piece  OR a  faulty  product !!,1,"got the phone delivered within a day . Excellent service. But I guess the responsibility ends there itself.  the product is faulty .  Screen flickers ,  touch screen becomes un-responsive,  screen black out for a  few seconds is common and above all the  iphone heats  up horribly  to an extent that it made me uncomfortable holding the phone.  having read on  google now, it seems the product is faulty and heating is a common problem.  Fed up of liaising with Apple  & Amazon . hoping it will be replaced"
64,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Unbiased Review after 1 month of Usage,4,"Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro"
65,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Luckily got a good phone!,4,"Too new to rate. Some of the recent reviews were extremely scary for an Apple product and unfortunate that those customers were given bad products. Took a risk, ordered and told to cancel but Amazon force delivered the product. Opened and checked for defects, none so far.  Made in India, product is authentic! Thankfully not a refurbished phone. Verified the warranty, started using, so far so good. Will try update review periodically for your benefit."
66,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Happy with the product but not happy with the old phone exchange process,4,"Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process."
67,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Camera Quality is not good.,1,Camera is Defective.
68,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Major issue with Mike n speaker,1,"I am having Mike n speaker issue, n due to lockdown I dint got chance to return it, but I dint expected this Frm amazon surely not with product like APPLE"

70,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Best device ever by apple,5,Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-‚Ä¢Wide angle camera‚Ä¢Supports fast Charing‚Ä¢Stunning looks‚Ä¢Superb Camera quality‚Ä¢Safe and secure device ‚Ä¢Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-‚Ä¢The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp‚Ä¢Still have huge notch‚Ä¢Bit costly in India
71,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Not a great phone,1,"The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn‚Äôt respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it‚Äôs been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it‚Äôs the worst product from Apple. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it‚Äôs not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn‚Äôt work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don‚Äôt find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly."
72,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Best performance of all time in an Iphone,5,You won‚Äôt regret it If you buy it .Camera quality is awesome and performance of this phone is next level. Lucky to have this phone in pocket
73,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,"Mobile was soo heating,",1,Please do not buy this
74,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Worst Camera,1,"Worst purchase for such huge amount that was spent. Camera quality is very poor, my galaxy s9 plus is much better than this one. Amazon doesn‚Äôt accept return but the options in the app shows return applicable. iPhone claims to have best camera and has large hoardings everywhere but in reality it‚Äôs not.Totally regret on this purchase."
75,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Only 5 GB iCloud Storage not good!,3,"If you are going from Android to IOS, You are going to suffer on few things:- Google provides 15 GB storage for google photos.- ICloud provides only 5 GB Storage and always ask for the money to buy storage as notification.- You will not be able to move or restore your whats app data from Android to IOS without using any 3rd party paid software.>>>Pros<<<<<- Camera Quality is Awesome.- Battery is OK.- Look is awesome.- Face Recognition is also OK.- Sound is nice.- Touch experience is top notch for the Android users.- Single SIM can be inserted and 2nd SIM would be eSIM and will have to visit Airtel store or JIO Store.>>>>>Cons<<<<<<- iCloud storage is low for photos.- Battery would have been better.- Earphone/EarPods or charger cannot be used as the sametime."
76,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Fake product,1,So the charger adapter is the old the 5w one but in other videos i have seen it has the new one i feel like something is wrong.
77,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Defective handset,1,"I have recieved this product from Appario retail on 14th Jun and the handset is not detecting SIM card. I have also got the handset checked at unicorn Apple service centre ,Defence colony Delhi , who have confirmed in writing  that the handset is defective. I want the product to be returned or replaced at the earliest"
78,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Worst quality iPhone was delivered,1,"a bad and defective piece iphone11 was delivered to me . Battery, Camera etc are substandard. Phone gets heated even while talking. Its takes 8 hours to do full charge. seller has given me a defective product"
79,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,DONT BUY IT FROM AMAZON,1,"the seller appario retail ltd. gives old used and defective pieces. and if you go to get replacement they(apple) dont entertain you becoz you got it from amazon. you should get apple products from apple.com . they are 4-5k costlier but atleast you know for sure that the product is new and not defective. and even when you hah\ve any issue, you can contact apple and they will help you. but if you buy from amazon, very high probability that you might get defective piece from this seller and apple wont help you much."
80,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Happy with my phone!,5,"I‚Äôve always been fascinated with iPhones but never bought one, due to lockdown I had postponed my shopping for few months but my older phones was bugging me a lot so I had to buy new one,At first I wasn‚Äôt sure about online shopping for iPhone but this pandemic left me no choice, ultimately I ordered after a long contemplation and I should say I‚Äôm happy with the purchase... I wouldn‚Äôt keep using it and then I‚Äôll update my review according to my experience"
81,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Damaged and used,1,Scratches over backside
82,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,The phone hangs,3,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price."
83,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,So far so good...(1 week user),4,"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer."
84,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Quality review,1,Product is not upto mark......Voice quality issue... Left speaker is not working......I am of firm opinion that the phone are refurbished one which are sold on Amazon.I be never ever be buying iPhone on Amazon
85,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Disappointed with amazon,5,"Phone is great but I am really disappointed by amazon service. It was applicable for bonus 1 offer and I was suppose to get cashback of 1250 and an executive said expect it by wednesday but when it dint credit on chking with amazon executive again they said its not applicable!There was no stars or mentioned in FAQs that iphone is not applicable for bonus.Felt like wrong advertisement, cheated and really disappointed by amazon offers and services. Been amazon customer for years and this experience is really was very disappointing. Feels like lost the trust in amazon :( Wrong advt and incorrect offers was just never expected from amazon!"
86,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Don't Buy from amazon they are selling refurbished faulty products.,1,Got the phoneWithin 10 days it started randomly shutting down.Apple says it's a hardware problemBut amazon is not replacing it because return window ended 2 days back.Amazon customer care representative clearly said that it's not amazon problem.They have washed off their hands.BEWARE OF AMAZON!!!!
87,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Defective battery,4,Battery is defectiveAfter charging 100per the battery percentage drops into zero(0)From nowdays I will never trust Amazon .....It's not a single penny it's about 48kFor common person it's huge amountAnd no one will not accept such defective items.Meanwhile I tried to return but AmazonDirectly said talk to appleIs that fair ?@AMAZONI can say loudly that Flipkart is far better than Amazon I know theirs item price is high but atleast they care after being delivered
88,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,Refurbished,1,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†Really disappointed. This purchase has saddened me so much. This was my first iPhone purchase ever, I was so happy but when I unboxed the product, I saw a gap between the frame and back glass, this may be a refurbished product. I will not purchase costly products again from Amazon."
89,New Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White,The best you can get!,5,It‚Äôs just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don‚Äôt have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won‚Äôt go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.
